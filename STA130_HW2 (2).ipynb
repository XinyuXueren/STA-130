Which mainly because it can response to your question immediately so you are more likely to reamin the current operation in you mind rather then forget what you do last when you spend a lot of time in online research(such as Google). In addition, The response of ChatGPT to a Code-Question is a combination of both word-describetion and code-example, so I'm more likely to understand the point that I asked. However, it just an AI Tool sometime will make the questions or knowledge more abstract(i.g. in Calculus Proof), therefore, as an user of ChatGPT, I do need have a basic understanding of the field of questions I asked."

The different choice might lead to the different types of result, more completed thinking can support us to the result we want in higher possibility. I'd like to include this ability in my following expection. In positive way, Ai assisstance will strongly support students in their learning in Statistical field, which is not only because it can answer your questions professionally but also it can ask immediately. In negative way, frequent use of AI assistant can make students form dependence, it would hurt their ability of autonomous learning. In summary, I believe that the using of AI assisstance in the field of statistic and etc. has possibility in both positive and negative direction, what we can do it to use it wisely to help our learning."

    "    In this conversation, we discussed the importance of continuous learning and adaptability in the data science industry. You also asked about the most in-demand skills for data scientists and how knowledge of statistics empowers professionals to derive meaningful insights from data. We then explored whether it's possible to be a statistician or data scientist without coding or data analysis skills, concluding that while it's possible in certain roles, coding and analysis are crucial for most positions. Finally, since you aspire to be a mathematician, I highlighted that the most important capacity for that goal is problem-solving ability, along with abstract thinking, logical reasoning, and perseverance.\n",

In addition, continuous learning and adaptability is the key to get academic and career success. With mathematics increasingly intersects with fields like data science, AI, and quantum computing. Coding and data analysis skills will enhance my ability to apply mathematical concepts in real-world contexts. Early in my career, I'll likely engage in research or applied roles, progressing to leadership positions in academia or industry. Perseverance and collaboration across disciplines will be essential for long-term success.\n",

ChatGPT generates a very professional analysis of our topic, however, I don't feel that I get the efficient help from its response, not only because its answer include too many terms that I can't undersatnd clearly, but also I'll easily lost patience in chatbot-style analysis(especially when Chating with them). I believe it's because I treat academic problem as \"asking questions and getting answers\". In this case, I can ignore ChatGPT's identity(Non-people). However, I can't treat ChatGPT as a firendly to chat with. Therefore, I can't get help from ChatGPT's \"professional analysis\".\n"
